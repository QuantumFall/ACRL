# ACRL

Actor-critic reinforcement learning. Requires you to download the datafile and notebook. 

The front part of the notebook contains a section to load the data and group the items into baskets, 
which will then be recommended by the agent based on the profile.
The baskets recommended are based over a period of one year depending on the target budget and calorie intake. 

The environment has been created similar to those used in typical RL gyms such as the cartpole env. 
This makes it compatible with typical RL methods as well.

Data used in this repo has been artifically created/manipulated. Any resemblance to real-world data is purely coincidental.
